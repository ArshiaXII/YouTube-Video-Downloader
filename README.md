# YouTube Video Downloader

This project allows you to download YouTube videos or just their audio directly to your computer. The project is developed using the Python programming language and the tkinter library for the graphical user interface. 

## Description

This application provides a simple and intuitive user interface where you can paste the URL of the YouTube video you want to download. You can choose to download the video in different qualities or download only the audio as an MP3 file. The application uses the `youtube_dl` library to handle the download process.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You also need `youtube_dl` library which you can install via pip:

pip install youtube_dl

## Usage
After cloning the repository and installing the necessary dependencies, you can run the main.py script:
python main.py


A window will open where you can paste the URL of the YouTube video you want to download. Select the quality of the video you want or click on the "Download Audio" button if you only want the audio. The file will be downloaded to the same directory as the script.
